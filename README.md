# NisabaDB

**Build the paper graph first. Distill shared mathematical knowledge from evidence.**

NisabaDB is a paper corpus, proof-bearing paper graph, and future mathematical knowledge graph. Its gold corpus currently contains *A Dimension-Free Dictatorship Tester on the Symmetric Group* and Braverman--Khot--Lifshitz--Minzer's *An Invariance Principle for the Multi-slice, with Applications*. The website presents reviewed paper-local mathematics as interactive dependency graphs, theorem pages, and linearized distilled papers. Canonical cross-paper Knowledge is deliberately withheld until the corpus is broad enough to justify simplification and compression.

The intended canonical domain is `nisabadb.org`. Until that domain is configured, the project is deployable through GitHub Pages.

## What works

- Paper-first navigation for Papers, Knowledge, Unsolved, and Learn
- A bounded, cycle-safe citation-ancestry DAG projection, processing backlog, and paginated paper catalog
- One expandable dependency DAG per paper, containing every paper-facing result without topic sub-tabs
- Search, status filters, route-sensitive dependency highlighting, and stable deep links
- Explicit original, minimized, and candidate-reinterpretation route roles with independent review state
- Persistent statement/proof reader with source locations, Lean declarations, and axiom audit
- Prover-neutral formal-artifact schema and reproducible submission lifecycle; Lean 4 is the first populated adapter
- Topologically generated distilled-paper view with optional prerequisite expansion
- Explicitly gated Knowledge and Learn surfaces, so paper-local claims are not mislabeled as a global curriculum
- An intentionally empty Unsolved surface until a conjecture passes a dated literature-status review
- Thousands of provisional paper records discovered through a resumable recursive citation queue
- Validated TypeScript content model and a persistent OpenAlex ingestion queue
- Responsive, keyboard-accessible React interface with KaTeX rendering

The corpus contains 2,143 paper records: 2 gold rewrites and 2,141 provisional papers, connected by 2,284 citation records. The two reviewed paper graphs contain 93 mathematical nodes. Human-readable compressed routes are complete for 36 of 61 theorem-like nodes. Every remaining item is labeled as a proof idea or a proof not yet distilled; source-omitted proofs and unresolved source inconsistencies are never promoted to complete routes. The canonical Knowledge layer currently contains zero nodes by design.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 24 or a compatible current release.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The development server prints its local URL. Other useful commands are:

```sh
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm run check
```

`npm run check` runs linting, all tests, TypeScript compilation, and the production build.

## Rebuild the mathematical corpus

The generated public corpus is committed at `src/data/corpus.json`. Its immutable inputs are:

- `chen1088/dict_lean` at commit `4b6c455234729dd554df5e35058cdd2940fd2c2b`
- the 2026-07-15 shortened author manuscript with SHA-256 `ea9950ff8e7c7114386dc24536b1ce13a74aed40a7116f47f7b2725910a6e239`
- the reviewed citation audit at `data/citations/direct-neighborhood-audit.json`
- the pinned `arXiv:2110.10725v2` source audit and original NisabaDB paper pack at `scripts/paper-packs/bklm-invariance.mjs`
- the multislice citation audit at `data/citations/multislice-neighborhood-audit.json`

The manuscript is not committed because no public full-text reuse license was found. With read-only local checkouts of both inputs, regenerate the corpus with:

```sh
npm run citations:snapshot
node scripts/import-dict-lean.mjs --source <dict_lean-checkout> --manuscript <shortened-manuscript.tex> --timestamp <ISO-8601-time>
npm run content:validate
```

The snapshot command merges the reviewed direct-neighborhood baseline into the existing queue and preserves recursively discovered papers, edges, and progress. Use `npm run citations:snapshot -- --reset` only when an intentional return to the audited baseline is required.

The importer verifies that the supplied Lean checkout is at the pinned commit, retains an untouched copy of the legacy graph data under `data/source-snapshots/`, then assembles reviewed paper packs over the durable citation snapshot. It never commits either source paper. The promotion and merge rules are described in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Continue citation ingestion

Preview the next safe no-write invocation:

```sh
npm run citations:ingest -- --max-items 1
```

Fetch and persist one queued paper neighborhood:

```sh
npm run citations:ingest -- --live --max-items 1
```

Provider responses are stored as gzip-compressed provenance envelopes under `data/citations/cache/`, including their URL and retrieval time. Deduplication uses exact stable identifiers only—never title similarity alone. The batch size limits work per invocation, not graph depth; newly discovered records and unresolved provider IDs remain queued for later runs.

The first recursive batch processed ten identified papers. The durable queue now has 2,143 records: 2,103 metadata-fetched papers ready for neighborhood work, 36 blocked on stable provider identity, 3 complete direct neighborhoods, and 1 `neighbors-fetched` record awaiting deduplication/review. Twelve initially blocked records were reactivated after the crawl supplied exact OpenAlex identities. After accepting queue updates, regenerate `src/data/corpus.json` using the import command above and run `npm run check`.

Citation records are discovery and provenance evidence, not theorem dependencies. A raw citation network can contain cycles; the Papers page therefore shows a bounded rooted ancestry projection with explicit layer-respecting paper-to-paper relations and disclosed truncation, without claiming that the underlying citation network is itself a DAG.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` run the GitHub Pages workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`. It installs locked dependencies, runs the complete check, builds with the `/nisabadb/` base path, and deploys the `dist` artifact. Client-side route fallbacks are included for deep links.

No `CNAME` is committed yet: configure DNS for `nisabadb.org` first, then add the verified custom domain in GitHub Pages.

The public site remains static. Authenticated contributions, automated prover runs, mathematical review, and admin-only publication require the separate control-plane and worker service described in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md); they are not simulated by the public client.

## Provenance and reuse

NisabaDB stores metadata, exact source locations, source links, and newly written proof distillations. It does not republish the source manuscript or third-party full text. Every formal link is pinned to a commit, and verification labels distinguish kernel checking, axiom auditing, and still-pending human–formal alignment.

See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for precise coverage and remaining gaps, and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the data model and continuation path.
