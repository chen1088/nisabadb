## Formal trust boundaries

The development contains two named mathematical inputs:

- `booleanU1_dictator_classification_input`
- `fknStability_input`

Several finite checks also expose Lean's generated `native_decide` trust axiom. Every displayed formal declaration lists its full audited footprint, including the standard logical axioms `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`. The site therefore uses granular labels such as `conditional formalization`, `axiom audited`, and `human–formal alignment pending`; it currently makes no `fully certified` claims.

NisabaDB corrects eleven source statements or definitions whose displayed manuscript wording omitted a necessary range. Each record preserves the uncorrected wording in a disclosure rather than silently replacing it:

- Theorem 2.1 is displayed for `n >= 1`; the Lean wrapper assumes the same, its named input assumes `3 <= n`, and the small positive ranks are handled separately. The unrestricted formal `n = 0` formulation is false.
- Theorem 2.2 is displayed for `n >= 4`, matching its Lean wrapper and named FKN input.
- Proposition 4.5 and Lemma 4.6 are displayed for `n >= 4`, matching their proofs and Lean declarations. Proposition 4.5's unrestricted claim is false at `n = 3`.
- Definition 5.10 makes `m >= 1` explicit; Lean additionally supplies a coherent `m = 0` extension.
- Lemma 5.12's matching-count clause, Lemmas 5.13 and 5.15, Proposition 5.16, and Lemma 5.18 make `m >= 1` explicit because their matching-indexed objects are introduced only in that range.
- Lemma 5.17 is displayed for `m >= 2`, the range in which the manuscript's recursive expression is defined.
- Theorem 2.1 attribution differs between the manuscript (Ellis–Friedgut–Pilpel 2011 and Ellis–Filmus–Friedgut 2017) and `dict_lean/ASSUMPTIONS.md` (Filmus 2021, Theorem 2.8). NisabaDB preserves the discrepancy pending review.
- Human–formal route alignment has not yet been signed off by a mathematical reviewer, even where both representations are present.

## Citation coverage

The author manuscript contains 19 bibliography entries, but only 17 are cited in the text. NisabaDB represents exactly those 17 as direct outgoing edges. `DFLLV2021` and `BowmanDeVisscherOrellana2013` remain audit-only bibliography entries and are not falsely presented as direct citations.

The featured manuscript has no DOI, arXiv ID, OpenAlex ID, DataCite record, or Semantic Scholar match. OpenAlex, Crossref, arXiv, DataCite, and Semantic Scholar returned no exact target identity. Consequently, zero provider-visible incoming edges does **not** establish zero real citations. The featured record is blocked on identity resolution. Of its 17 known outgoing neighbors, 16 have OpenAlex identities and are independently runnable; the James–Kerber book record is also blocked pending resolution of a provider work identity.

## Remaining mathematical work

1. Distill complete proofs of the two imported Section 2 inputs from their primary literature and expose any additional prerequisite nodes they need.
2. Resolve the Theorem 2.1 attribution discrepancy and rank-edge cases with the authors/formalizers.
3. Perform independent mathematical review of the 31 compressed proofs.
4. Review human statement-to-Lean and proof-step-to-declaration alignment before elevating any status.
5. Add examples/nonexamples to more definition nodes where they materially improve understanding.
6. Continue the citation queue and later promote selected provisional papers to gold rewrites.

These are labeled gaps, not hidden completion claims.
